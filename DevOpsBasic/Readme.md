# DevOps
* It is a **ProManTo** word that is combination of Development and Operational
* `PETULA`
* Development 
    1. Plan 
    2. Execution 
    3. Test
* Operational 
    1. UAT (User Acceptance Testing) -> it is a temporary server where customent can execute there and verify everything
    2. Live -> after successful UAT and deploy it into Live server
    3. Assistance
* Why we go for devOps is, once development is complete they given the product to operational team then during their work may be **configuration file** not supporting the production environment or some **dll** files won't support, in these cases operational team blame development team and development blame that's their mistake (operational team).
* DevOps is a **philosophy** where both development team and operational team work together instead of blaming each other to deliver smooth product to the customer.
