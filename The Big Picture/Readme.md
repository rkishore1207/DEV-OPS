# Definitions of DevOps.
* DevOps utilize some cultural philosophies, software practices and tools to make the product(project) to deliver quickly with the high quality.
* And it helps automate and integrate the process between software development and IT teams, so they can build, test and release software more quickly and reliably.
## Create Product based Mindset
* Funding is based on Output.
* Success is also based on how our product creates value on market.
* If once team is formed we will work with those team members only not often changing the team members.
* Once if the product is completely then only we deliver it, so here there is no fixed delivery date.
* No documentation is required.
