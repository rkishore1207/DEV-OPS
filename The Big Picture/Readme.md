# Definitions of DevOps.
* DevOps utilize some cultural philosophies, software practices and tools to make the product(project) to deliver quickly with the high quality.
* And it helps automate and integrate the process between software development and IT teams, so they can build, test and release software more quickly and reliably.
## Create Product based Mindset
* Funding is based on Output.
* Success is also based on how our product creates value on market.
* If once team is formed we will work with those team members only not often changing the team members.
* Once if the product is completely then only we deliver it, so here there is no fixed delivery date.
* No documentation is required.
## What changes when you start doing devops.
1. Culture
2. Organization
3. Practice
4. Technology

### Culture
* `Taking Ownership`
    1. **Shared commitment to Excellence** -> that is quality of product is not only depend on QA, it's depend upon all environments so everyone should take ownership of what they are doing.
    2. **Empowerment and Accountability** -> we should give chances to others as well as we should responsible to ourself.
    3. **Trust and Safety** -> whatever decision we could take that must be trustable and doesn't affect others.
* `Adopt Product Thinking`
    1. Thought about outcomes
    2. Deep understanding of customers
    3. Requires change from IT project oriented
* `Focus on the Customer`
    1. Thinking about the `Jobs to be done`
    2. Frequent customer interactions
    3. develop customer feedback loops
* `Make Data Driven Decisions`
* `Adopt Continuous Improvement Mindset`
    1. **Constant learning and react accordingly** -> we should have the ability to transform information into usable data.
    2. It's hard to fix what you don't measure
    3. Be smart about where to focus versus fix everything
### Organization
* `Assess Team Staffing and Structuring`
    1. **IT is often organised by a Functional team** -> having architects, business analyst, developers, QA, production level. So not all levels are working in a particular time one is wait for others to be complete
    2. But in devops having people who have all skills and everyone work at a time if they even lagging in something, the orgs can give training to them.
* `Rethink Budgeting and Funding`
    1. Most of the companies funding projects not products
    2. They should consider how to fund outcomes with measurable success metrics.
* `Create Platform and SRE (Site Reliability Engineers)`.
* `Establish Open communication`

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Poor communication leads to push not pull, because if somebody interest what they want, they will post and get pull the work.
### Practice
* `Keep Scaling Agile Delivery` -> Devops stretches agile ideas beyond the software team.
* Establish a small batch delivery
* Expand test automation and CI/CD
* Make work visible -> by agile and lean
### Technology
* Start Value stream Mapping
* `Embrace Flexible planning tools`
    1. Track sprints while planning your sprints and releases
    2. Improve transparency and reduce waste and identify blockers
* Consolidate Issue tracking system
* Expand the use of sourec control
* Focus on CI/CD pipelines
* Leverage configuration management
* Take advantage of Public cloud
* Improving Monitoring and Ovservability
* Infuse Security practices throughout
